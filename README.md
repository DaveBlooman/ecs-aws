============================


### Create a Cluster

Create a cluster in the console or CLI before creating this stack.  Use this cluster name in the next step

### Create ECS nodes

Upload the ECS template, this will create 3 CoreOS nodes running the ECS agent with full access to the ECS API.  You are now able to run containers using ECS.
